Here are detailed **test cases for a lift (elevator)**, covering functional, UI, performance, security, and edge cases.

---

### **1. Functional Test Cases**
| Test Case ID | Test Scenario | Expected Result |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| TC_01 | Press the lift call button | Lift should arrive at the floor |
| TC_02 | Press floor button inside the lift | Lift should move to the selected floor |
| TC_03 | Press multiple floor buttons | Lift should stop at all selected floors in order |
| TC_04 | Open and close doors manually using buttons | Doors should open/close properly |
| TC_05 | Test maximum weight limit | Lift should not move if overloaded and display an alert |
| TC_06 | Call lift from two floors at the same time | Lift should prioritize based on proximity |
| TC_07 | Check movement direction (Up/Down) | Lift should move in the correct direction |
| TC_08 | Verify the emergency stop button | Lift should stop immediately when pressed |
| TC_09 | Test alarm button | Alarm should ring when pressed |
| TC_10 | Test lift movement without selecting any floor | Lift should remain idle |

---

### **2. UI/UX Test Cases**
| Test Case ID | Test Scenario | Expected Result |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| TC_11 | Check display panel | Should show current floor and direction |
| TC_12 | Verify button illumination | Selected floor buttons should light up |
| TC_13 | Test accessibility features (e.g., braille buttons) | Visually impaired users should be able to use the lift |
| TC_14 | Verify door close/open button visibility | Buttons should be clearly labeled |
| TC_15 | Check announcements (if available) | Voice announcements should match floor and direction |

---

### **3. Performance Test Cases**
| Test Case ID | Test Scenario | Expected Result |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| TC_16 | Measure lift speed between floors | Should move within expected time limit |
| TC_17 | Test response time for call button | Should respond within acceptable delay |
| TC_18 | Continuous usage test (simulate peak hours) | Lift should function without errors or breakdowns |
| TC_19 | Test emergency battery backup | Lift should switch to backup power if main power fails |

---

### **4. Security Test Cases**
| Test Case ID | Test Scenario | Expected Result |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| TC_20 | Verify fire emergency response | Lift should not operate during fire alarm activation |
| TC_21 | Check door sensors (obstruction test) | Lift doors should reopen if obstructed |
| TC_22 | Test lift malfunction alert | Alert should notify maintenance team if there is a failure |
| TC_23 | Test lift locking mechanism | Lift should lock when under maintenance |
| TC_24 | Check security access (if applicable) | Restricted floors should require authentication |

---

### **5. Negative & Edge Cases**
| Test Case ID | Test Scenario | Expected Result |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| TC_25 | Press multiple buttons rapidly | System should not freeze or malfunction |
| TC_26 | Try to open doors while lift is moving | Doors should not open while in motion |
| TC_27 | Power failure test | Lift should stop safely and switch to backup |
| TC_28 | Try to exceed maximum capacity | Lift should trigger overload alert and prevent movement |
| TC_29 | Test extreme weight on one side of the lift | Should not cause imbalance or instability |

---

### **6. API Test Cases (if lift is IoT-enabled)**
| Test Case ID | Test Scenario | Expected Result |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| TC_30 | Send API request to call lift | Lift should respond as per request |
| TC_31 | Validate API response for lift status | API should return correct current floor and status |
| TC_32 | Test API failure handling | System should gracefully handle API downtime |

---

### **Final Notes**
- **Automation Testing:** Use Playwright or Cypress for IoT-enabled lifts.
- **Load Testing:** Simulate high traffic to check lift response.
- **Security Testing:** Ensure unauthorized access is restricted.
