1. 3Sum
- Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
- Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

2. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- The "Search in Rotated Sorted Array" problem is a common question in coding interviews. It involves searching for a target element in a sorted array that has been rotated at some pivot. For example, the array [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2] is a rotated version of [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7].


3. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- Given a rotated sorted array nums (with no duplicate elements), find the minimum element in the array.


4. Maximum Product Subarray
- Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray that has the maximum product and return the product.

5. Maximum Subarray
- Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum, and return the sum.
