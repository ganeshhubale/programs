1. 3Sum
    - Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
    - Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

2. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
    - The "Search in Rotated Sorted Array" problem is a common question in coding interviews. It involves searching for a target element in a sorted array that has been rotated at some pivot. For example, the array [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2] is a rotated version of [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7].


3. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
    - Given a rotated sorted array nums (with no duplicate elements), find the minimum element in the array.


4. Maximum Product Subarray
    - Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray that has the maximum product and return the product.

    - Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum, and return the sum.

6. Product of Array Except Self
    - You are given an integer array nums of length n, where ùëõ ‚â• 2. Return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

7. Contains Duplicate
    - Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

8. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
    - You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.
    - You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

9. Two Sum
    - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
    - You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
    - You can return the answer in any order.

10. Finding Pairs With a Certain Sum
    - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return all unique pairs of numbers in the array that add up to the target.
    - You should not use the same element twice, and the order of the pairs does not matter.


11. Maximum Number of Occurrences of a Substring **Not solved**
    - You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the maximum number of occurrences of any substring of s that satisfies the following conditions:
    - The substring's length is between minLength and maxLength (inclusive).
    - The substring contains at most maxLetters unique characters.
    - Return the maximum number of occurrences of such substrings.

12. Maximum Average Subarray I
    - You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements and an integer k.
    - Find the maximum average value of any contiguous subarray of size k. You need to return this maximum average as a floating-point number.

13. Merge Two Sorted Lists
    - You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists, list1 and list2. Merge the two lists into a 
single sorted linked list and return the head of the merged list. 
The merged list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

14. Find Peak Element
    - A peak element in an array is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given an integer array nums, find a peak element and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index of any one of the peaks.

15. Permutation in String
    - The Permutation in String problem is a common question that involves checking whether one string's permutation is a substring of another string.
Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.
In other words, one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

16. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
    - Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

17. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs
    - Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of pairs (a, b) such that: a + b= k
Each element in nums can only be used once in a pair.

18. Longest Common Subsequence **Not solved**
    - The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence common to two strings. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

19. Subarray Product Less Than K
    - Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all elements in the subarray is less than k.

20. String to Integer (atoi)
    - The String to Integer (atoi) function converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (-2^31 to 2^31 -1).
The function must strip any leading whitespace, handle optional signs, and stop at invalid characters or when the string ends.

21. Isomorphic Strings
    - Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. 
Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in one string can be replaced to get the other string, preserving the order of characters. 
No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

22. Longest Palindromic Substring
    - Given a string s, find the longest substring in s that is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

23. Sort Characters By Frequency
    - Given a string s, return a string where the characters are sorted by frequency of occurrence in descending order.

24. Rotate Array
    - Given an array nums and an integer k, rotate the array to the right by k steps.

25. Maximum Length Substring With Two Occurrences **Not understood**
    - To find the maximum length substring with exactly two distinct characters (also known as the "Longest Substring with Two Occurrences"), we can use a sliding window approach.
    - Input: A string s.
    - Output: The length of the longest substring that contains exactly two distinct characters.

26. Existence of a Substring in a String and Its Reverse
    - To check whether a substring exists in a string and also in its reverse, here is the explanation and implementation:

27. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
    - The problem "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II" asks us to maximize the profit by performing multiple transactions

28. Two Out of Three
    - You are given three integer arrays, nums1, nums2, and nums3. A number is said to appear in two out of the three arrays if it exists in at least two of the arrays.
    - Your task is to return a list of all such numbers in any order.

29. Shortest String That Contains Three Strings **Not understood**
    - You are given three strings a, b, and c. Your task is to find the shortest string that contains all three strings as substrings. 
    - If there are multiple results of the same length, return any one of them.

30. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
    - You are given a string s consisting of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Your task is to find the number of substrings that contain at least one occurrence of each of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
