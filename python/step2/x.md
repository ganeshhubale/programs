**Test Plan for AI-Based Issue Search in Jira**

---

#### **1. Introduction**
- **Purpose**: This test plan outlines the strategy, scope, and approach for testing the "AI-Based Issue Search" feature in Jira. The feature allows users to search for issues using natural language, which is translated into JQL (Jira Query Language) queries.
- **Scope**: Testing will cover the search functionality, JQL translation, execution, and user interface interactions. It will include functional(Integration testing) and Non-functional (performance and usability) testing.
- **Objectives**: 
  - Ensure the AI-based search accurately translates natural language into JQL.
  - Validate that search results match the user's intent.
  - Verify the usability and performance of the feature.

---

#### **2. Test Objectives**
- Validate the accuracy of natural language to JQL translation.
- Ensure search results are relevant and accurate.
- Verify the ability to edit and re-execute JQL queries.
- Test the usability and responsiveness of the feature.
- Confirm seamless switching between AI search, Basic search, and JQL search.

---

#### **3. Test Scope**
- **In-Scope**:
  - Natural language input and JQL translation.
  - Execution of JQL queries and display of results.
  - Editing and re-executing JQL queries.
  - Switching between AI search, Basic search, and JQL search.
  - Performance and usability of the feature.
- **Out-of-Scope**:
  - Testing of save filter.
  - Testing feedback (upvote/downvote) for AI quality.
  - Testing of filtered results in different views.
  - Testing of export, share or opening it in third party apps.

---

#### **4. Test Strategy**
- **Types of Testing**:
  - **Functional Testing**: Validate the accuracy of JQL translation and search results.
  - **Usability Testing**: Ensure the feature is intuitive and user-friendly.
