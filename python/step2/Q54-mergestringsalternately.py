# Merge Strings Alternately
#     - You are given two strings, word1 and word2.
#     Merge the two strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1.
#     If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters at the end.

# word1 = "abc"
# word2 = "pqr"
# Output: "apbqcr"
# Merge alternately: "a" + "p" + "b" + "q" + "c" + "r" â†’ "apbqcr"

# Two pointer
